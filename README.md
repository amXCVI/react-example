This project was made as a test task for creativehandles.

The application is written with React JS using the following libraries:
    • material-ui for displaying standard components, such as buttons, social network icons, menus, etc, as well as for building a grid.
    • infinite-react-carousel for displaying a slider with customer reviews
The entire page is designed to subject to RWD (responsive web design) and perfectly displays on devices with any screen. If it was necessary, media queries were used to clarify the behavior of the page when changing the screen width.
By splitting the page into separate small elements and putting the reused components in the components folder, the code has a clear structure and is easy to read.
